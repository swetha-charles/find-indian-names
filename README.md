# find-indian-names

To run the script, make sure first the data is in place. To do this, make sure:
1. the file "indian_names.csv" contains the known set of Indian names
2. the file "names_to_check.csv" contains all the names that we want to test 

After this run the following command to run the script: `./find_indian_names.sh > output.csv`. 

This will create a file where each entry will either be deemed Indian or not.
